By default, all libraries mentioned below (except Windows/DirectX SDK) are assumed to be in
the src\Externals directory.

To build X-Ray Engine you'll need following libraries:
* OpenSSL: https://www.openssl.org/source
  - Prebuilt binaries can be downloaded here: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
* OpenAutomate: https://developer.nvidia.com/openautomate
* NVAPI: https://developer.nvidia.com/nvapi
* libjpeg: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg
  - Use "jpeg" as project root directory name for compatibility with CxImage
* zlib: http://zlib.net
* BugTrap: https://github.com/nitrocaster/BugTrap
* FreeImage: http://freeimage.sourceforge.net
* FreeMagic
* libogg-1.1.4: http://xiph.org/downloads
* libtheora-1.1.1: http://xiph.org/downloads
* libvorbis-1.2.3: http://xiph.org/downloads
* Autodesk Maya 2008/2009 SDK
* Autodesk 3DS Max 6.0 SDK
* Windows SDK: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279
* DirectX SDK June 2010: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812
  - replace dxguid.lib with the one from Windows SDK
    (for DirectPlay GUIDs)
XXX nitrocaster: add LuaJIT & LuaBind instructions

You can download all these libraries (except Windows/DirectX SDK) with compiled binaries here:

Setup:
------
- Install S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat
- Install patch 1.6.02 (only for russian locale, worldwide release should have it included):
  http://cop.stalker-game.ru/?page=patches#2
- Download and unpack archive with libraries
- Create _bin_dbg_Win32, _bin_mix_Win32 and _bin_rel_Win32 folders in the game installation directory
  (Debug, Mixed and Release binaries for 32-bit Windows). Hereinafter '_bin_xxx_Win32' is referred to as 'xbin'.
- Copy following files from bin to xbin:
  - dbghelp.dll
  - eax.dll
  - wrap_oal.dll
- Copy following files from bin to xbin\dedicated:
  - eax.dll
  - wrap_oal.dll
- Copy following files from src\Externals\BugTrap\Bin to xbin:
  - Debug configuration:
    - BugTrapD.dll (rename to BugTrap.dll)
  - Other configurations:
    - BugTrap.dll
- Copy following files from src\Externals\OpenSSL\bin to xbin:
  - libeay32.dll
  - ssleay32.dll
- Create soft link to /gamedata in the game installation directory:
  $ mklink /D <game installation directory>\gamedata <xray-16 repository root>\res\gamedata  
- After successful build use xrbinup.cmd to update game binaries:
  $ xrbinup.cmd "E:\Program Files (x86)\GSC World Publishing\STALKER-COP" %src% Win32 Debug  
- You can create cmd script to update binaries in a single click, for example:
  @echo off
  setlocal
  set src="E:\git\xray-16"
  set dst="E:\Program Files (x86)\GSC World Publishing\STALKER-COP"
  call xrbinup.cmd %dst% %src% Win32 Debug
  endlocal

XXX nitrocaster: add script for copying/renaming/soft linking
