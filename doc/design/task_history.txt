TITLE: X-Ray Engine 1.6 task history

--------------------------------

nitrocaster: Pavel Kovalenko
+ get rid of STLPort
- bugs
  + fix lights_hanging_lamp class name in system.ltx (used 'SO_HLAMP', should be 'O_HLAMP')
  - core
    + xrMemory::mem_usage -> mem_usage_impl falls into infinite loop or finds bad nodes
  - render
    + dx10StateUtils::ValidateState(D3D_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC&) doesn't initialize passed D3D_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC with
      proper default values when DepthEnable flag is false. Because of this incorrect initialization previously created
      state cannot be found, so renderer creates it over and over.

  - plugins
    + fix LW and Max exporters (seem to be broken by GSC)
