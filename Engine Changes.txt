Feel free to add to this list anything that comes to mind that would be related to modifying the COP source.
If you've implemented a given feature already by experimenting on the CS source, put a star next to it.

1) Convert to 64-bit (to allow more than 4gb RAM to be used)
2) Multi-thread the engine for up to 4 cores
3) Solve stuttering problem (likely due to LuaJit. Solution would be to upgrade it to newest version and then rewrite all the lua files to conform with it)
4) Solve problem with COP sometimes not loading correctly upon launch on some systems as well as not always exiting properly and still running as a background task.
5) Get BugTrap to spit out better error logs
6) Solve problem with stealth mechanics
7) Fix shadow bug in DX10 where a big world shadow appears and disappears depending on what angle you are in relation to the sun
8) Eliminate usage of precompiled shaders so they can all be modified at will like in SOC
9) When DX12 comes out, add DX12 renderer (doesn't sound like it has much new graphics-wise, but it is crazy faster than DX11)
10) Allow more than 2 ammo types per weapon without screwed up/missing UI ammo count
11) Allow environment mapping for weapons not on DX8 (I found the file responsible, just need someone to implement it)
12) Allow .seq files to be given a stop frame/point (animated blood puddles underneath bodies anyone?)
13) Allow wallmarks to have bump and bump# usage (for glossy blood and for bullet-holes that do things like take small chunks out of cement)
14) Better tessellation in DX11/12. Modify current method plus implement artist controlled displacement mapping or something else that allows more control over usage
15) 3D shell casings (I know this can sorta be done in only LUA, but it would be simpler just to hardcode it)
16) Replace current shadowing system with one with better antialiasing and less "noise" when a character is in an interior and moving around


SDK
1) Less errors and crashes, loads of these.
2) Visible level-loaded decals and the ability to see decals that aren't just 'wallmarkblend' type.
3) 'Undo' function that doesn't take minutes to do and actually works properly.
4) Better performance
